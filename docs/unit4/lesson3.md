###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: " 
    Data collected through Participatory Sensing Campaigns will be used to create models that answer real-world problems related to our community.

###**Lesson:**
1. Display the DWP data using RStudio. In pairs, ask students to recall what each of the variables
mean.

2. Next, ask student teams to refer back to the statistical questions they generated in the previous lesson - they will need it for the data exploration.

3. An option for checking the credibility of sources is the SIFT method (The "SIFT" method is adapted from [https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/](https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/ "https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/"){:target="_blank"} by Michael A. Caulfield):

    100. **Stop** - First, ask yourself if you know and/or trust the source of the page. Don't read it or share it until you know what it is. Second, if you have started working through the moves and find yourself in a “click cycle”, STOP and remind yourself what your goal is - don’t lead yourself astray down a rabbit hole of facts/links.

    100. **Investigate the Source** - Take time to figure out where it is from before reading it. If it’s from an unfamiliar source, do a Google or Wikipedia search. Here’s a video to help with investigating a source: <br>
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=hB6qjIxKltA](https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=hB6qjIxKltA "https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=hB6qjIxKltA"){:target="_blank"}

    100. **Find Trusted Coverage** - This is where we determine if a claim is reliable. Do a Google News search for relevant stories and use known fact-checking sites like snopes.com, factcheck.org, or politifact.com. If there are images in your source, you can do a reverse image search via Google to check its validity or if it’s used elsewhere. Here’s a helpful video on how to do a reverse image search: <br>
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=7eKG9RuqUE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=7eKG9RuqUE4 "https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=7eKG9RuqUE4"){:target="_blank"}

    100: **Trace claims, quotes, and media back to the original context** - A lot of what we see on the web is a re-reporting or commentary of a story. When you see phrases like “As reported by…” or “According to…”, it can be an indication of this. Here’s a video to help navigate finding an original source: <br>
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=tRZ-N3OvvUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=tRZ-N3OvvUs "https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=tRZ-N3OvvUs"){:target="_blank"}

4. Now that you know how to check the credibility of sources, we will review characteristics of a participatory sensing campaign.

5. Move on to review their class created campaign from Unit 3. Using a Pair-Share strategy, ask students to discuss when a Participatory Sensing campaign should be used rather than a survey. <span style="color:grey"> Answers will vary. Research questions that include variation across time or across locations are good candidates for Participatory Sensing campaigns; therefore, a trigger is necessary in order to record observations at multiple time points and locations. If a question needs to be answered only once, then a survey is a better method. </span>

6. Remind students that in the last unit, they created one campaign for the entire class. In this unit, each student team will be creating and implementing a campaign on a topic that addresses a community concern or interest.

7. Distribute the *Team Campaign Creation* handout ([LMR_4.4](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_6.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_6.0/LMR_4.4_Team Creation Campaign.pdf)). Use the remainder of the class for students to find and review articles that will be the basis for their team participatory sensing campaigns. They will decide on a topic today and continue to create their campaigns in the next class period. Facilitate the student teams' brainstorm session by circulation around the room to check for understanding. If teams need help with finding an article and choosing a topic, you may recomend one of the following:

8. Take time near the end of class to have student teams share out their chosen topics.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the day were.

###**Homework:**
Students will come up with at least 2 possible research questions for their participatory sensing campaign. They will come to a consensus about their research question with their team in the next class period
