##***<u>Lesson 5: So Many Questions* [The Data Cycle: Ask Questions]</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will learn the features of a good statistical investigative question.

###**Materials:**
1. Post-its

###**Vocabulary:**
(statistical) investigative questions

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    Statistical investigative questions typically begin with a vague general question, then develop into a precise question. The process of developing or creating a good investigative question is iterative and requires time and effort to get right. In her 2021 paper, What Makes a Good Statistical Question, Dr. Pip Arnold identified the following as features of a good investigative question:

    (1) The variable(s) of interest is/are clear 

    (2) The group or population we are interested in is clear 

    (3) The question can be answered with the data 

    (4) The question asks about the whole group, not an individual or portion of the group 

    (5) The intention is clear (e.g., summary, comparison, association, time series)

    (6) The question is one that is worth investigating, is interesting, and has a purpose


###**Lesson:**
1. Entrance Slip (see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf) in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)): Each student should submit a
ticket that displays the 4 components of the Data Cycle.

2. Inform students that they will learn about what makes a good investigative question. Ask them to recall the definition of an investigative question: Investigative questions are questions that address variability and can be answered with data. They are questions we ask of the data. A good way to determine this is to ask: *Do we need to see the data to answer the question?*

3. Remind students of the two questions from the previous lesson, noting that one of the questions was an investigative question, and the other was not:

    100. How old am I?

    100. How old are the students in my school?

4. In pairs, ask students to analyze each question using the definition of a statistical question and
come to an agreement about which one is a statistical question.

5. Using Agree/Disagree (see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf) in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)), ask a pair of students
for their results. Discuss why the first question **IS NOT** a statistical question (<span style="color:grey">***there is only one
possible value so there is no variability in the data***</span>) and why the second question **IS** a statistical question (<span style="color:grey">***not all students are the
same age. The ages vary, so there is variability in the data***</span>).

6. Ask students to think of the data they collected about the stick figures (name, GPA, friends, sport, height, shoe). Inform them that the researchers used the following survey questions to collect the data:
    100. What is your name?

    100. What is your GPA?

    100. How many friends do you have?

    100. What sport do you play?

    100. How tall are you in inches?

    100. What type of shoe do you mostly wear?

    Survey questions are another example of a type of statistical question, but with a different purpose to investigative questions. Survey questions are questions we ask to get the data.

7. Tell students that it is important to know exactly what survey questions were asked to collect the data before asking investigative questions. For example, we saw an image of a ball next to each stick figure but we don’t know if that represents a sport they like to watch, their favorite sport, or a team they are on.

8. In teams, ask students to create investigative questions that could be answered using the data collected about the stick figures. Introduce the sentence stem “I wonder…” to help students get started. Have the Recorder/Reporter record the questions on post-its. 

9. Ask the teams to identify which variable(s) each question is investigating by having them circle the variable name(s) within their investigative questions.

10. Have the Task Manager organize their group’s investigative questions on the board, placing investigative questions that incorporate only one variable on the left-hand side of the board and investigative questions that incorporate two or more variables on the right-hand side.

    Note: This sorting activity will help students begin to distinguish between summary investigative questions, which are questions about a single variable, and comparison or association investigative questions, which incorporate multiple variables. Comparison investigative questions compare a numerical variable across groups. Association investigative questions look for a relationship between paired numerical or paired categorical variables.

11. As a class, begin the process of transforming some of the summary investigative questions so that they have all of the features of a good investigative question. Here is an example to get you started:


    Question 1: *I wonder who has the most friends?*

|**Feature**|**Explanation**|
|--------|--------|
|The variable(s) of interest is/are clear|Yes. The variable of interest is the number of friends.|
|The group or population we are interested in is clear.|No. Teacher should ask: “Who did the researchers want to learn about?”<br> <span style="color:grey">These stick figures</span>.|
|The question can be answered with the data.|Yes, the researchers collected data on the number of friends.|
|The question asks about the whole group, not an individual or portion of the group.|No. This question is about an individual stick figure. Teacher should ask: “How can we reword the question to include the whole group?”<br> <span style="color:grey">How many friends do ... have?</span>|
|The intention is clear (e.g., summary, comparison, association).|It is clear that this is a summary investigative question (single variable), specifically the number of friends.|
|The question is one that is worth investigating, is interesting, and has a purpose.|For students, this might be something interesting.|




###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Ask students to bring at least 2 cutouts of the “Nutrition Facts” labels of the snacks they typically eat (e.g.,
chips, yogurt, blended drinks, etc.).

**<u>Note:</u>** An alternative to collecting “Nutrition Facts” labels is to print them from an online source and bring
the printouts to class.
