### interquartile range (IQR)

!!! note ""
      the range from Quartile 1 to Quartile 3

### maximum

### mean of absolute deviations (MAD)

!!! note ""
      the average distance between each data value and the mean

### measures of central tendency (or center)

!!! note ""
      a central or typical value for a probability distribution

### measures of variability (or spread)

!!! note ""
      how far away the data points tend to fall from the center

### median

!!! note ""
      the middle value in a group of ordered observations

### merge

!!! note ""
      to come together or combine

### minimum

!!! note ""
      the smallest value

### model

!!! note ""
      a way of representing real world situations so that predictions can be made

### normal curve

!!! note ""
      curve or the graph is the common type of distribution for a variable

### normal distribution

!!! note ""
      an arrangement of a data set in which most values cluster in the middle of the range

!!! note ""
      parts per 100; for each hundred; a fraction whose denominator (bottom) is 100

### probability

!!! note ""
      how likely it is that some event will occur

### proportion

!!! note ""
      when two ratios (or fractions) are equal

### quantiles
!!! note ""
      a term that can be used in place of percentiles because they represent a *quantity* of data that is lower than that value

!!! note ""
      the values that divide a list of numbers into quarters

### randomness

!!! note ""
      happening by chance; not able to be predicted

### range

!!! note ""
      the largest value minus the smallest value

      the form in which data is stored, processed, and transmitted

### sample proportion

!!! note ""
      the fraction of samples which were successes

### shuffle

!!! note ""
      rearrange so as to occupy different random positions or to be in a different random order

### simulation

!!! note ""
      a way of creating random events that are close to real-life situations without actually doing them

### standard deviation (SD)

!!! note ""
      a measure of how spread out numbers are; the square root of the variance

### standardized score

!!! note ""
      another name for z-score

### subset

!!! note ""
      a set of which all the variables are contained in another set.

### third quartile (Q3)

!!! note ""
      a number for which 75% of the data is less than that number

### typical

!!! note ""
      “mean” or “average”; expected values

### with replacement

!!! note ""
      when a population element can be selected more than one time

### without replacement

!!! note ""
      when a population element can be selected only one time

### z-score

!!! note ""
      tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean an observation is
